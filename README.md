<p id="description">This project showcases a Cloud-Native CI/CD pipeline for deploying a Flask application using AWS Kubernetes (Kind) and GitHub Actions. The infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform and hosted on AWS EC2 while GitHub Actions automates the build and deployment process. The Flask app is containerized and orchestrated using Kubernetes with Helm managing the deployment. Key components include: AWS EC2 for hosting the Kind cluster. Kubernetes (Kind) for container orchestration. GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation. Terraform for provisioning cloud resources. Flask App with S3 integration and MySQL support. This setup highlights best practices in cloud-native deployment DevOps and infrastructure-as-code workflows.</p>
